    title={HarsanyiNet: Computing Accurate Shapley Values in a Single Forward Propagation},
    author={Chen*, Lu and Lou*, Siyu and Zhang, Keyan and Huang, Jin and Zhang, Quanshi},
    abstract={The Shapley value is widely regarded as a trustworthy attribution metric. However, when people use Shapley values to explain the attribution of input variables of a deep neural network (DNN), it usually requires a very high computational cost to approximate relatively accurate Shapley values in real-world applications. Therefore, we propose a novel network architecture, the HarsanyiNet, which makes inferences on the input sample and simultaneously computes the exact Shapley values of the input variables in a single forward propagation. The HarsanyiNet is designed on the theoretical foundation that the Shapley value can be reformulated as the redistribution of Harsanyi interactions encoded by the network.},

    title={Audio-text retrieval in context},
    author={Lou, Siyu and Xu, Xuenan and Wu, Mengyue and Yu, Kai},
    booktitle={IEEE International Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing},
    abstract={Audio-text retrieval based on natural language descriptions is a challenging task. It involves learning cross-modality alignments between long sequences under inadequate data conditions. In this work, we investigate several audio features as well as sequence aggregation methods for better audio-text alignment. Moreover, through a qualitative analysis we observe that semantic mapping is more important than temporal relations in contextual retrieval. Using pre-trained audio features and a descriptor-based aggregation method, we build our contextual audio-text retrieval system. Specifically, we utilize PANNs features pre-trained on a large sound event dataset and NetRVLAD pooling, which directly works with averaged descriptors. Experiments are conducted on the AudioCaps and CLOTHO datasets, and results are compared with the previous state-of-the-art system. With our proposed system, a significant improvement has been achieved on bidirectional audio-text retrieval, on all metrics including recall, median and mean rank},
